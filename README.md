# About me

My name is Brenno, and I am a software engineer with a focus on declarative programming and extensive experience in Swift. I believe that the use of declarative paradigms, such as SwiftUI and Combine, can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

I am passionate about technology and love working on challenging and innovative projects. With my experience in mobile app development, I have worked with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products.

My work can be found on my Medium profile, where I write about Swift programming and share my experiences. I am always looking for new learning and collaboration opportunities.
